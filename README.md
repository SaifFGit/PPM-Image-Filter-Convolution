# PPM Image Filter Convolution

This program receives a PPM image as input and applies a kernel filter to it using convolution to produce an output image. It supports many different image processing filters including the mean filter, Gaussian blur filter and the sharpen filter. I also implemented memory management techniques to allow images with up to 3840x2160 resolutions to be generated in under 3 minutes.
